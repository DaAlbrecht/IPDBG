# IPDBG - the environment to debug your IP - SigrokPatches

We don't plan to develop our own UI. But you can find a sigrok fork on [github](https://github.com/LUMERIIX/libsigrok.git).
It contains support for ipdbg.org's logic analyser. So sigrok-cli and PulseView can be used with ipdbg.org's logic analyser.
We merge more or less regularly with origin [sigrok.org](git://sigrok.org/libsigrok).
