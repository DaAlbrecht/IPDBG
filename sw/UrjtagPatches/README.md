# IPDBG - the environment to debug your IP - urJTAG patches

You can find a urJTAG fork on [github](https://github.com/danselmi/urjtag.git).
It contains support for ipdbg.org's TAP. So it can be used with not supported Architecutes/Vendors or devices without JTAG interface.
Additionally it has support for some more devices (xc7k325t, ...).
